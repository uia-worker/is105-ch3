> The CPU has 10.4 million transistors, an order of magnitude more than the RAD6000 (which had 1.1 million).[3] It is manufactured using either 250 or 150 nm photolithography and has a die area of 130 mm2.[1] It has a core clock of 110 to 200 MHz and can process at 266 MIPS or more.[1] The CPU can include an extended L2 cache to improve performance.[3] The CPU itself can withstand 200,000 to 1,000,000 rads (2,000 to 10,000 gray), temperature ranges between –55 °C and 125 °C and requires 5 watts of power.[1][3] The standard RAD750 single-board system (CPU and motherboard) can withstand 100,000 rads (1,000 gray), temperature ranges between –55 °C and 70 °C and requires 10 watts of power.[3]

The RAD750 system has a price that is comparable to the RAD6000, the latter of which as of 2002 was listed at US$200,000 (equivalent to $284,292 in 2019).[4] Customer program requirements and quantities, however, greatly affect the final unit costs.
